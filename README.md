# Weather App README

Welcome to my Weather app! This README.md file provides you with essential information on system requirements, installation, configuration, project creation, running the project, troubleshooting, and additional resources. Follow the steps below to set up and run the app successfully.

## System Requirements

Make sure your development machine meets the following specifications:

- **CPU:** Intel Core i5 / AMD Ryzen 5 or higher
- **RAM:** 8GB or higher
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 (64-bit)

## Installation Instructions

1. **Node.js:** Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended).

2. **Expo CLI:** Install Expo CLI globally by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```

## Configuration Steps

No additional configuration steps are required for a basic setup. However, check the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/) for advanced configuration options.

## Project Creation

To create a new React Native Expo project, use the following commands:

```bash
expo init YourProjectName
cd YourProjectName
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project configuration.

## Running the Project

1. Navigate to your project directory.

2. Run the following command to start the development server:

    ```bash
    expo start
    ```

3. Expo DevTools will open in your default web browser. From there, you can run the app on an Android Device Simulator or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your physical device.

## Troubleshooting

### Debugging
